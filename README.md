RetinaFace is a deep learning based cutting-edge facial detector for Python coming with facial landmarks. Its detection performance is amazing even in the crowd as shown in the following illustration.

RetinaFace is the face detection module of [insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) project. The original implementation is mainly based on mxnet. Then, its tensorflow based [re-implementation](https://github.com/StanislasBertrand/RetinaFace-tf2) is published by [Stanislas Bertrand](https://github.com/StanislasBertrand). So, this repo is heavily inspired from the study of Stanislas Bertrand. Its source code is simplified and it is transformed to pip compatible but the main structure of the reference model and its pre-trained weights are same.

## Installation [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/retina-face.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/retina-face/)

The easiest way to install retinaface is to download it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/retina-face/). It's going to install the library itself and its prerequisites as well.

```shell
$ pip install retina-face
```

Then, you will be able to import the library and use its functionalities.

```python
from retinaface import RetinaFace
```

**Face Detection** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/Wm1DucuQk70)

RetinaFace offers a face detection function. It expects an exact path of an image as input.

```python
resp = RetinaFace.detect_faces("img1.jpg")
```

Then, it will return the facial area coordinates and some landmarks (eyes, nose and mouth) with a confidence score.

```json
{
    "face_1": {
        "score": 0.9993440508842468,
        "facial_area": [155, 81, 434, 443],
        "landmarks": {
          "right_eye": [257.82974, 209.64787],
          "left_eye": [374.93427, 251.78687],
          "nose": [303.4773, 299.91144],
          "mouth_right": [228.37329, 338.73193],
          "mouth_left": [320.21982, 374.58798]
        }
  }
}
```

**Alignment** - [`Tutorial`](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/23/face-alignment-for-face-recognition-in-python-within-opencv/), [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/WA9i68g4meI)

A modern face recognition [pipeline](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/01/a-gentle-introduction-to-face-recognition-in-deep-learning/) consists of 4 common stages: detect, [align](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/23/face-alignment-for-face-recognition-in-python-within-opencv/), [normalize](https://sefiks.com/2020/11/20/facial-landmarks-for-face-recognition-with-dlib/), [represent](https://sefiks.com/2020/12/14/deep-face-recognition-with-arcface-in-keras-and-python/) and [verify](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/22/fine-tuning-the-threshold-in-face-recognition/). Experiments show that alignment increases the face recognition accuracy almost 1%. Here, retinaface can find the facial landmarks including eye coordinates. In this way, it can apply alignment to detected faces with its extracting faces function.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
faces = RetinaFace.extract_faces(img_path = "img.jpg", align = True)
for face in faces:
  plt.imshow(face)
  plt.show()
```

**Face Recognition** - [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/WnUVYQP4h44)

Notice that face recognition module of insightface project is [ArcFace](https://sefiks.com/2020/12/14/deep-face-recognition-with-arcface-in-keras-and-python/), and face detection module is RetinaFace. ArcFace and RetinaFace pair is wrapped in [deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) library for Python. Consider to use deepface if you need an end-to-end face recognition pipeline.

```python
#!pip install deepface
from deepface import DeepFace
obj = DeepFace.verify("img1.jpg", "img2.jpg"
          , model_name = 'ArcFace', detector_backend = 'retinaface')
print(obj["verified"])
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/retinaface/master/tests/outputs/retinaface-arcface.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>

Notice that ArcFace got 99.40% accuracy on [LFW data set](https://sefiks.com/2020/08/27/labeled-faces-in-the-wild-for-face-recognition/) whereas human beings just have 97.53% confidence.

## Contribution [![Tests](https://github.com/serengil/retinaface/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/serengil/retinaface/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Pull requests are more than welcome! You should run the unit tests and linting locally before creating a PR. Commands `make test` and `make lint` will help you to run it locally. Once a PR created, GitHub test workflow will be run automatically and unit test results will be available in [GitHub actions](https://github.com/serengil/retinaface/actions) before approval.
